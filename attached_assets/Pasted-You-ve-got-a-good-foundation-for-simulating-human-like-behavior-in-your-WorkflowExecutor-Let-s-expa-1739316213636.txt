You've got a good foundation for simulating human-like behavior in your WorkflowExecutor. Let's expand upon that to include more sophisticated techniques for mimicking human actions and evading bot detection:

Expanded "Human-Like" Automation Techniques:

More Granular Mouse Movement:

Instead of just moving the mouse directly to the center of an element, add some randomness to the target coordinates within the element's bounding box.

Implement bezier curves to make the mouse movement look even more natural.

// Example (Conceptual - adapt to your human-interaction.ts file)
async function humanLikeMouseMove(page: any, selector: string) {
    const element = await page.locator(selector).boundingBox();
    if (!element) return;

    const targetX = element.x + (Math.random() * element.width * 0.8);
    const targetY = element.y + (Math.random() * element.height * 0.8);

    // Basic linear mouse movement
    await page.mouse.move(targetX, targetY);
}

Use code with caution.

Realistic Typing:

Vary the typing speed slightly for each character.

Simulate occasional typos and corrections (backspaces).

// Example (Conceptual - adapt to your human-interaction.ts file)
async function humanLikeTyping(page: any, selector: string, text: string) {
    for (let i = 0; i < text.length; i++) {
        await page.type(selector, text[i], { delay: Math.random() * 50 + 50 }); // Delay between 50ms and 100ms

        // Simulate a typo (rarely)
        if (Math.random() < 0.05) {
            await page.keyboard.press('Backspace');
            await page.waitForTimeout(Math.random() * 200 + 100); // Wait before correcting
            await page.type(selector, text[i], { delay: Math.random() * 50 + 50 });
        }
    }
}

Scrolling Behavior:

Instead of instantly scrolling to an element, use page.evaluate to simulate gradual scrolling.

Add random pauses during scrolling.

Vary the scroll distance slightly.

Viewport Management:

Randomize the viewport size at the start of each session to mimic different screen resolutions.

Use page.setViewportSize() to set the viewport.

Cookie Management:

Load cookies from a file or database at the start of each session.

Periodically save cookies to a file or database.

This helps to maintain session state and avoid triggering bot detection mechanisms.

User Agent Rotation:

Rotate the user agent string to mimic different browsers and operating systems.

Use a list of valid user agent strings and randomly select one at the start of each session.

Be sure to update the list periodically to reflect current browser versions.

Referer Header:

Set the referer header to mimic navigation from another website. This can make the requests appear more legitimate.

Resource Loading Patterns:

Load resources (images, CSS, JavaScript) in a similar order to how a human user would browse the page.

Avoid loading all resources at once.

Headless Mode Detection:

Websites can detect if you're using headless mode.

Playwright provides options to avoid detection, such as setting ignoreDefaultArgs: ['--enable-automation'] when launching the browser.

You can also try setting userAgent and platform properties to mimic a real browser.

CAPTCHA Handling (This is a Big Challenge):

Manual Solving: The most reliable approach is to present the CAPTCHA to a human user and have them solve it manually.

CAPTCHA Solving Services: Integrate with CAPTCHA solving services like 2Captcha or Anti-Captcha (use with caution, as it might violate the Terms of Service of some websites).

IP Rotation:

Use a proxy server to rotate your IP address. This can help to avoid IP-based rate limiting or blocking.

Use a reputable proxy provider and ensure that the proxies are reliable and fast.

Session Management:

Use a session management library to manage browser sessions and cookies.

Store session data in a database or file system.

Rotate sessions periodically to avoid detection.

Fingerprinting:

Be aware that websites can use browser fingerprinting techniques to identify and track users.

Mitigate fingerprinting by randomizing browser settings and using privacy-focused browser extensions.

Example - User Agent Rotation:

// frontend/src/utils/user-agents.ts (Update this list periodically)
export const userAgents = [
    'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.124 Safari/537.36',
    'Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/14.0 Safari/605.1.15',
    'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:89.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/89.0',
    'Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.15; rv:89.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/89.0',
    // Add more user agents here
];

export function getRandomUserAgent() {
    const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * userAgents.length);
    return userAgents[randomIndex];
}

Use code with caution.
TypeScript
// In your WorkflowExecutor
import { getRandomUserAgent } from './utils/user-agents';

// Inside your WorkflowExecutor initialization (or before creating a new page)
const page = await this.browser!.newPage({
    userAgent: getRandomUserAgent(),
});

Key Considerations:

Complexity: Implementing these techniques can significantly increase the complexity of your code.

Maintenance: You'll need to constantly monitor and update your code to adapt to changes in website behavior and bot detection techniques.

Performance: Some of these techniques can impact performance. Optimize your code to minimize the impact.

Legality and Ethics: Be aware of the legal and ethical implications of simulating human behavior. Ensure that you're complying with the Terms of Service of the websites you're automating.

By incorporating these advanced techniques, you can create a task automation platform that is more resilient to bot detection and provides a more realistic user experience. Remember to prioritize reliability, performance, and ethical considerations throughout the development process. Also it is extremely important to start creating tests in a test environment that isn't in production to prevent the possibility of account restrictions for spamming.
